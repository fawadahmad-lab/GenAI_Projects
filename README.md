## ‚ú® About

**GenAI_Projects** is a repository where I explore cutting-edge **Generative AI** technologies. Each project in this repository is aimed at solving real-world problems and showcasing the power of the latest AI advancements. From natural language processing (NLP) to image generation and beyond, this repository is all about exploring and creating with **Generative AI**.

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Text Generation**: Leveraging models like **GPT** and **BERT** for powerful natural language understanding and generation.
- **Conversational AI**: Building intelligent chatbots using platforms like **OpenAI**, **LangChain**, and **Hugging Face**.
- **Image Generation**: Exploring state-of-the-art tools like **DALL-E**, **Google Gemini**, and **Meta‚Äôs LLaMA**.
- **AI-powered Applications**: Developing real-world applications using cutting-edge **Generative AI** models.

## üíª Technologies

This repository includes projects that use the following technologies:

- **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)**: Leveraging **transformers** and pre-trained models for various NLP and generative tasks.
- **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: An innovative framework that combines multiple LLMs (Large Language Models) and APIs to create conversational agents.
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)**: Working with OpenAI‚Äôs **GPT models** for various NLP applications.
- **[Google Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/ai-machine-learning/google-gemini)**: Using Google‚Äôs powerful **Gemini** models for advanced natural language processing.
- **[Meta LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)**: Exploring Meta's **LLaMA** family of models, such as **LLaMA 3.1:1B** and its variants.
- **APIs**: Utilizing the latest APIs from these platforms to build and integrate AI into applications.
